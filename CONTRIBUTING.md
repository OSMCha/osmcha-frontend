# Contributing to OSMCha

The current OSMCHA is broken into two repositories. You can file bug in any of these repositories.
1. [osmcha-django](https://github.com/willemarcel/osmcha-django) Handles the backend of the OSMCha.
2. [osmcha-frontend](https://github.com/mapbox/osmcha-frontend) Is the frontend application.

## Code of Conduct

[Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) and remember to be nice to one another.

## Reporting Issues

We'd love to hear what you think about OSMCha, about any specific problems or
concerns you have. Here's a quick list of things to consider:

Please [search for your issue before filing it: many bugs and improvements have already been reported](https://github.com/search?l=&q=repo%3Amapbox%2Fosmcha-frontend&type=Issues)

To report a bug:

* Write specifically what browser (type and version, like "Firefox 49.0"), OS,
and browser extensions you have installed
* Write steps to replicate the error: when did it happen? What did you expect to happen?
What happened instead?
* We love screenshots.  If you can take a picture of the issue, that is extra helpful.
You can drag the image file onto the GitHub issue and it will be included with your bug report.
* You can use a program like [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record an animated gif.
* Please keep bug reports professional and straightforward: trust us, we share your dismay at software breaking.
* If you can, [enable web developer extensions](http://debugbrowser.com/) and report the
JavaScript error message.

When in doubt, be over-descriptive of the bug and how you discovered it.
