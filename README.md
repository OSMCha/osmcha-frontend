OSMCha is composed by a group of softwares that together has the aim to make it
easier to monitor and validate the changes in OpenStreetMap. [Learn more â€¦](ABOUT.md)

- Production instance: https://osmcha.org
- Test instance: http://osmcha-django-staging.tilestream.net/

This repository contains the frontend code. Other repositories are:
* [OSMCha backend code](https://github.com/willemarcel/osmcha-django)
* [OSMCha python library](https://github.com/willemarcel/osmcha) is used to analyse the OSM changesets
* [OSM Compare](https://github.com/mapbox/osm-compare) is used to analyse OSM features
* [OSM Changeset Viewer](https://github.com/osmlab/changeset-map) is used to display the changeset on the main map


## Setting up editor

### Prettier
This repository uses [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to keep the code consistent and formatted. You can config your favourite editor by the following links
- Atom users can simply install the [prettier-atom](https://atom.io/packages/prettier-atom) package and use Ctrl+Alt+F to format a file (or format on save if enabled).
- Visual Studio Code users can Search for Prettier - JavaScript formatter.

### Prerequisite
- Make sure your node version is *9.1*.
- Install `yarn` globally using `brew install yarn`.
- Install `watchman` globally with `brew install watchman`.

### Local development
1. `yarn start`
1. Open [https://localhost:3000/?filters={%22date__gte%22%3A[{%22label%22%3A%222017-05-01%22%2C%22value%22%3A%222017-05-01%22}]}](https://localhost:3000/?filters={%22date__gte%22%3A[{%22label%22%3A%222017-05-01%22%2C%22value%22%3A%222017-05-01%22}]})
    - The app runs with https; Firefox is recommended since it allows self signed certificates.
    - The staging database only has changesets until mid 2017; without the filter you will not see any changesets.

*To sign in:*

1. After loading the page in your browser, inspect the request made to `social-auth/` and copy the `oauth_token`;
1. In other browser tab, access `https://www.openstreetmap.org/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=<oauth_token>` and give authorization in the OpenStreetMap page that will load;
1. You will be redirected to a blank page that has a `oauth_verifier` in the url. Copy the `oauth_verifier`;
1. Click on the `Sign in` button on your local OSMCha instance, paste the `oauth_verifier` and you will be logged in.

### Local testing
Test the application before commiting any changes. If you encounter any error make sure you have `watchman` installed. [Installation Guide](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).

```bash
yarn test
```

## Deploy/Release
- There are three stacks to deploy to
- ~~`yarn deploy:dev` deploys it to `mapbox.github.io`~~ (currently broken)
- `yarn deploy:staging` deploys it to `staging.osmcha.org`
- `yarn deploy:prod` deploys it to `osmcha.org`

1. Run the tests with `yarn test`

2. (optional) before deploy, you might want to increment the version number of application.
    * We use `minor` for all non-drastic changes.
    * The `patch` is reserved for minor changes.
    * We try to stick to sem-ver.
    ```bash
    npm version minor
    ```


3. Then build the app with the following command.
    ```bash
    yarn build:<stack>
    ```
    * here stack could be `dev`, `staging`, `prod`. Refer to package.json for more info.

4. The next step involves deploying the `build` folder to github. If you get an error like this `error: failed to push some refs to 'git'` while doing the deploy step. Run `rm -rf node_modules/gh-pages/.cache/`.
    ```
    yarn deploy:<stack>
    ```
    * here stack could be `dev`, `staging`, `prod`. Refer to package.json for more info.
    * `oh-pages` branch handles the build for `staging`, `prod` stacks.
    * `gh-pages` branch handles the build for `dev` stack.


5. (optional) If you want to see the new changes on a `staging` or `prod` stack. You will need to draft a new github release. The convention is to append `-staging` or `-production` or just `-server` to the current version tag for the server to consume the build and separate concerns.
    * for eg. if the version npm module version was `v0.16.3`.
    * draft a github release with a tag `v0.16.3-staging`. (Note the name spacing)
    * supply this version tag to the server.
    * Refer to githubs [article](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) for creating releases.
